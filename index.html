<h1>AI for Alzheimer's disease: prognostic challenge</h1>
</div>
<div class="wrapper" style="border-top:none;">
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<div>
<p>
The NIH-funded AIML <sup><a href="#footnote">[a]</a></sup> Consortium is launching a machine learning challenge to predict future clinical decline in elderly people who are cognitively healthy, or have mild cognitive impairment or Alzheimer’s disease. As we age, our brains tend to decline, but there is a wide variability between people who stay cognitively healthy until old age and those who develop dementia <sup><a href="#footnote">[b]</a></sup>. For elderly people with mild cognitive impairment, around 15% per year develop Alzheimer’s disease or a related form of dementia (e.g., Parkinson’s disease or vascular dementia). It is crucial to understand factors that predict future clinical decline, for treatment planning, selecting the correct treatments, and to identify and understand factors that resist or prevent dementia.
<br><br>

Recent work (van der Veere 2024)<sup><a href="#footnote">[c]</a><a href="#footnote">[d]</a></sup> shows the rate of clinical decline on a widely-used test, the Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE): 30 points is a perfect score, and a score of 0 means that all questions were answered incorrectly.

   <h2>Why a challenge?</h2>
   <p>Predictive models in machine learning often show excellent performance in publications, but may fail when tested on new data. Because published methods are not typically tested on the same datasets – or on sufficiently diverse data – it is often hard to tell which methods will perform best in practice, or when they will fail. <br><br>   On the bright side, AI competitions have ignited the field of deep learning for computer vision - the large-scale ImageNet (2012) dataset consisted of 14 million hand-labeled photographs; an annual benchmarking competition to identify these objects using AI methods greatly accelerated the fields of deep learning and AI.<br><br> Our challenge builds on the previously successful DREAM and TADPOLE challenges **add refs to these, and webpages about them**
